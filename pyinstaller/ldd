#
#     Musl's dynlinker comes with ldd functionality built in. just create a
#     symlink from ld-musl-$ARCH.so to /bin/ldd. If the dynlinker was started
#     as "ldd", it will detect that and print the appropriate DSO information.
#
# Instead, this string replaced "ldd" with the package so that pyinstaller
# can find the actual lib.
exec /usr/bin/ldd "$@" | \
    sed -r 's/([^[:space:]]+) => ldd/\1 => \/lib\/\1/g' | \
    sed -r 's/ldd \(.*\)//g'
